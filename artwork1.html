            <p>Blackness for Sale sheds light on how language used online mirrors colonization and slavery. Terms like Navigator, Explorer, and Safari evoke exploration, while the auctioning of Blackness echoes historical auctions of Black bodies and racist memorabilia on eBay. This project emphasizes that our online interactions are influenced by real-world histories, reminding us that even virtual exchanges are shaped by our physical experiences and backgrounds.</p>
