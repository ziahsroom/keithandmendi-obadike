            <h2>Impact on Net Art and Discussions About Race</h2>
            <p>In the nascent days of the internet, discussions about race were notably absent, and the realm of net art offered limited opportunities for Black voices to be heard. In response, Keith and Mendi Obadike's groundbreaking work emerges as a powerful force, redefining the internet as not just a repository of information but as a canvas for expressing the Black American experience. Their art provides a vital platform for exploring social issues and personal reflections, offering a beacon of expression in an otherwise barren digital landscape. Today, the influence of Black American culture pervades internet trends and vernacular, marking a significant shift from earlier times when such visibility was scarce. Through their pioneering efforts, the Obadikes have helped carve out a space where discussions about race flourish, contributing to a more inclusive and vibrant online community.</p>
